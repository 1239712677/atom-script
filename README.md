# Script runner for atom

Run snippets of scripts from within Atom.

Currently supports:

  * Python
  * CoffeeScript

You only have to add a few lines in a PR to support another.

To install simply run `apm install script`.

To use simply select some code and hit `cmd-i`. Your code will get run in
a fresh instance of the interpreter used by your scripting language.
