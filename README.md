Currently supports:

  * Python
  * CoffeeScript

You only have to add a few lines in a PR to support another.

## Installation

`apm install script`.

## Usage

Select some code and hit `cmd-i`. Your code will get run in
a fresh instance of the interpreter used by your scripting language.

If you don't select any text, it will run the entire file by default.

## TODO

* Tests, tests, tests
* Beautification
